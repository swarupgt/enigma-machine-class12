# enigma-machine-class12
A recreation of the WW2 German Enigma Machine in C++, as a class 12 Computer Science project.
Made by Swarup Totloor, Aditi Shanmugam and Utpal Balse.

Uses 3 rotors out of the available ones, custom rotor wirings can be added as well. 
The rotors are stored locally as text files.

Works like a regular Enigma machine, but doesn't support plugboards.
